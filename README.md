# Association-of-numeracy-with-self-rated-health
Investigate the association of numeracy scales with self-reported health status and healthcare-provider visits

Methods:
1. Hypothesis Testing: Fisher's test, Chisq test, t-test, ANOVA
2. Model building: Generalized linear regression (GLM), used both logistic regression for binary health outcome, 
and ordinal logistic regression for ordinal healthcare-provider visits outcome

Conclusion: higher nueracy is related to better health:
1. For self-reported health status, higher numeracy is related to better self-reported health status controlling other covariates in both ESP and PIAAC studies.
2. For healthcare-provider visits, in males, higher numeracy is related to less helthcare-provider visits controlling other covariates in ESP study. In females, 
there is no significant association between numeracy and healthcare-provider visits in ESP study.
